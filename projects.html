            <h2>Conway Game of Life</h2>
            <p><img src="gameoflife.jpg" alt = "Game of Life" style="max-width: 55%; height: auto;"></p>
            <p>In CISC 130, I wrote a program in C that ran Conway's Game of Life. You could set
                the starting positions of as many animals (represented as 1's) as you wanted by
                giving the row and column for the animal to be in or let it auto populate. It would
                then run one generation and then ask if you wanted another generation. This would 
                keep happening unless everything went extinct leaving a blank board.
            </p>
            <h2>Tenzi like game</h2>
            <p><img src="Tenzi.jpg" alt = "Tenzi dice" style="max-width: 40%; height: auto;"></p>
            <p>In CISC 230, I made a Tenzi like dice game where one could see how fast they could get
                all the dice to have the same value. The record's would be placed on a scoreboard that 
                would last as long as the program was running. There were ten die objects in a game 
                object. The game object and the scoreboard object were a part of the biggest object.
            </p>
            <h2>Single cycle computer</h2>
            <p><img src="singlecycle.jpg" style="max-width: 70%; height: auto;"></p>
            <p>In CISC 340, I worked with a partner to replicate a single cycle processor design. 
                It would 32-bit long values as input, and these vaules would tell it what command to
                run, and what registers and memory to use/change. The commands were add, nand (not and), 
                lw (load word), sw (store word), beq (branch on equals), noop (no operation), and halt.
                I would typically write the starting code, and I would trouble shoot it with my partner.
