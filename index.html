            <p>I am Stephen Hedman. My home is in Brooklyn Park, Minnesota, and I am a current 
                student of the University of St Thomas. I am majoring in Applied Mathematics 
                and will be graduating in Spring 2021. I have not really set up any goals for 
                after college just with how uncertain everything is right now.
