            <p>I am Stephen Hedman. My home is in Brooklyn Park, Minnesota, and I am a current 
                student of the University of St Thomas. I am majoring in Applied Mathematics 
                and will be graduating in Spring 2021. I have not really set up any goals for 
                after college just with how uncertain everything is right now.
            </p>
            <p>I have never had the best pictures because I cannot force what I am not feeling. If
                I am not in a mood to smile, any attempt to do so will look forced. If I am happy,
                you will see it. If I am playful, that is just how I will behave. I cannot lie with
                my body language.
