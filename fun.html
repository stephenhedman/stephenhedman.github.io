                I am a little bit of a Legend of Zelda enthusist. I have only played a few games in
                the series ("The Ocarina of Time", "Majora's Mask", "Link's Awakening" on Switch and 
                Breath of the Wild). With Breath of the Wild, I have done a deathless Ganon and am 
                currently working on a file that does 100% of none dlc content. It was unrealistic
                for me to try to find all 900 Korok seeds by exploring in game only, so I start to
                use a map to find them after finding approximately 75% of them.

                When I play non Legend of Zelda games, I tend to choose Link if that is a possibility.
                I drive as Link in "Mario Kart 8 Deluxe" and I typically play as Young Link in "Super
                Smash Bros. Ultimate". I have the Sheika Slate skin for my Switch, joy-cons and dock. 
                I also have an Ocarina that I have been trying to get really good on so that I can play
                whatever song I think of or am in the mood to play. If I do not think that just wearing
                a green short-sleeve shirt over a white long-sleeve shirt, I do have a tunic.
